## 📚 Student Exam Score Predictor

This project predicts a student’s exam score based on study habits and lifestyle factors using Machine Learning.
The final model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

## 🔍 Features Used:
  - Study hours per day
  - Attendance percentage
  - Mental health rating
  - Sleep hours
  - Part-time job status
  - Target variable: Exam Score

## 🤖 Models Trained:
  - Linear Regression
